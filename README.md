# Masters-Capstone

This is the repository containing the work done on my "Trabajo Fin de Máster" (Master's Capstone Project) for the Master's in Computational Biology at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid.

The code for the project can be found in "code.rmd" and the accompanying report is titled "TFM - Nicole Alexandra Frontero.pdf".  Please note that you will not be able to execute the code since the source data files are not in this repository.  They are not in this repository due to authorization rules.  Also, I have not included the .RDS files generated from the code due since they are too large to upload to GitHub.  

The code generated various output files which are included in this repository, including classification tree summary output files, generalized linear model summary output files, and "densityplots.pdf", which shows the alignment between the original the imputed data.
